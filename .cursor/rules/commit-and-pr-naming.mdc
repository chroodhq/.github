## Commit and PR Title Naming Convention

- All commit messages and PR titles must follow the internal naming pattern
- Format: `type(ticket-id): description in lowercase`
- Example: `feat(ENG-312): add OTA update process using aws lambda and iot core topic rule`

### Structure

**Pattern:** `type(TICKET-ID): brief description`

**Type Options:**
- `feat`: New feature or functionality
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality (includes performance improvements and code style changes)
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build, config)

**Ticket ID:**
- Always include the Linear/Jira ticket ID in parentheses
- Format: `PROJECT-NUMBER` (e.g., `ENG-312`, `PROJ-123`)
- Required for all feature work and fixes

**Description:**
- Use lowercase for the description
- Be concise but descriptive
- Start with a verb in imperative mood (add, update, fix, remove, etc.)
- No period at the end
- Focus on WHAT changed, not HOW

### Examples

✅ **Good:**
- `feat(ENG-312): add OTA update process using aws lambda and iot core topic rule`
- `fix(ENG-405): resolve race condition in mqtt reconnection handler`
- `refactor(ENG-201): extract device health validation to separate module`
- `docs(ENG-156): update api documentation for firmware endpoints`
- `test(ENG-312): add integration tests for ota firmware version comparison`

❌ **Bad:**
- `Add OTA updates` (missing type and ticket)
- `feat: Add OTA updates` (missing ticket ID)
- `feat(ENG-312): Added OTA updates.` (uppercase, past tense, period)
- `WIP: working on OTA` (not descriptive, no ticket)
- `fix bugs` (not descriptive, no ticket)

### PR Title Additional Requirements

- PR title should match the primary commit or describe the overall change
- Keep it concise (under 72 characters when possible)
- PR description should elaborate on:
  - What problem this solves
  - Why this change is needed
  - What the solution does
  - Any breaking changes or migration notes
  - Testing approach (include a **Test plan**; see `pr-test-plan.mdc`)

### Enforcement

- This convention must be followed by both humans and AI agents
- CI/CD may enforce this pattern in the future
- Reviewers should reject PRs/commits that don't follow the convention
