- Follow Liskov Substitution: any subtype/implementation must be safely usable wherever the base type/interface is expected
- Preserve contracts: do not strengthen preconditions or weaken postconditions in specialized implementations
- Maintain invariants and expected semantics (side effects, error behavior, return shape) across implementations
- If an implementation cannot honor the contract, split the abstraction or create a more specific interface/type
