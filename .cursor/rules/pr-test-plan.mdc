- Every PR must include a clear **Test plan** section
- The test plan should state:
  - what automated checks/tests were run locally (commands or task runner targets)
  - what manual verification was performed (scenarios, inputs, environments)
  - what was not tested (if anything) and why
- Prefer concise, copy/pastable commands and a short checklist of scenarios
