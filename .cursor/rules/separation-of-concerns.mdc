- Follow Separation of Concerns: divide code into distinct components, each handling a specific aspect of functionality
- Separate I/O and side effects from core logic so behavior is easier to test
- Keep orchestration (workflow) separate from implementation details (domain logic, persistence, integrations)
- Prefer composition between focused modules over entangling responsibilities in one place
