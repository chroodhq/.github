- Follow SRP (Single Responsibility Principle): each function, class, or module should have one reason to change
- Design around cohesive responsibilities; avoid “god” modules that mix unrelated concerns
- When responsibilities diverge, split the unit along responsibility boundaries
- Avoid flags/branches that turn one unit into multiple workflows with unrelated reasons to change
