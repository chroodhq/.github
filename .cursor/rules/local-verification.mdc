- Verify changes locally before asking for review or merging
- After substantive changes, run the repository’s relevant checks using existing project commands (see `pre-commit-checks.mdc`)
- Ensure the relevant test suite passes (at minimum: fast unit tests; add integration/e2e runs when changes touch boundaries or critical flows)
- If local verification is not possible, state this explicitly in the PR (what was not run and why) and provide an alternative verification approach
