- Refactor regularly to improve structure without changing behavior
- Keep refactors small and incremental; avoid mixing large refactors with feature changes unless necessary
- Use tests as a safety net: ensure relevant tests pass before and after refactors (see `unit-testing.mdc` and `pre-commit-checks.mdc`)
- Prefer mechanical, behavior-preserving refactors; keep changes easy to review
