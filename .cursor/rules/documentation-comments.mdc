- Use comments sparingly and only when they add durable value
- Comments should explain **why** (intent, constraints, trade-offs, non-obvious decisions), not **what** the code is doing
- Follow `inline-comments.mdc` for code comment policy; prefer durable documentation (`docs/`, root `README.md`, ADRs/issues) and link to rationale/context
- Keep comments accurate and maintained; delete outdated comments and avoid commented-out code
