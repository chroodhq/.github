- Follow YAGNI: implement functionality only when it’s actually needed
- Avoid speculative features and “just in case” extensibility
- Avoid premature optimization; optimize only when there is evidence (measured bottleneck, real constraint, or clear requirement)
- Prefer incremental delivery: ship the minimal useful change, then iterate based on real usage
- When designing APIs, support current use cases cleanly; generalize only when multiple real call sites demand it
