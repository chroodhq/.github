- Use meaningful naming: choose descriptive names that convey intent and domain meaning
- Avoid cryptic identifiers and abbreviations (e.g. `x`, `tmp`, `temp`, `cfg`, `mgr`) unless they are truly standard in this codebase
- Prefer clarity over brevity; a slightly longer name is fine if it prevents ambiguity
- Name things by what they represent, not how they’re implemented
- Use consistent naming patterns:
  - booleans read like predicates (`is_`, `has_`, `can_`, `should_`)
  - collections are plural; single items are singular
  - functions are verbs; types/classes/modules are nouns
