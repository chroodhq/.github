- Before committing changes, run the project’s local quality checks (use the existing repo commands: `make`, task runner, `npm run`, `just`, etc.)
- Run checks in this order (fast feedback, minimal churn):
  1. **Format / auto-fix** (including import sorting when applicable)
  2. **Type checking / static analysis** (when the language supports it)
  3. **Linting** (style + correctness)
  4. **Unit tests** (and other fast, deterministic tests)
  5. **Duplicate code detection** (optional but recommended; see `duplicate-code-detection.mdc`)
- Format, type checks, linting, and tests (when present) must pass before committing
- If any check fails:
  - Fix the issues
  - Re-run the checks to ensure no new issues were introduced
  - Only commit when the checks pass
- CI runs the same checks; running them locally prevents avoidable CI failures
