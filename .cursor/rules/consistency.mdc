- Be consistent: follow established formatting, naming conventions, and coding style across the codebase
- Keep APIs and naming uniform (similar concepts should look and behave similarly)
- Avoid mixing paradigms for the same problem; pick the dominant project approach and apply it consistently
- When adding new code, align file layout, structure, and organization with nearby/related modules
