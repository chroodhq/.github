- Follow Dependency Inversion: high-level policy should not depend directly on low-level details
- Depend on abstractions (interfaces/contracts) at boundaries when it adds value (multiple implementations, testability, or clear seams); avoid abstracting everything prematurely
- Inject dependencies instead of constructing them deep inside business logic (factories/composition root own wiring)
- Avoid hidden global dependencies; make required collaborators explicit in function/module APIs
