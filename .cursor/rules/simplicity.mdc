- Follow KISS: favor simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones
- Prefer the smallest change that solves the problem correctly
- Minimize moving parts: fewer layers, fewer indirections, fewer configuration knobs
- Choose boring, well-understood patterns over cleverness when both are correct
- Optimize for maintainability first; only add complexity when it clearly pays for itself
